      # On the local machine, which path to watch, from the root folder of the project.
      # For example /codewind-workspace/my-project would be /
      watchDir: /src # Optional, otherwise assumed to be the root /

    typeDetection: # Optional: Rules that are used to detect if this IDP is applicable to a given project (eg OpenLiberty IDP for an OpenLiberty-based app)
    # At least one rule must match for a type; ie this is an OR clause list, not an AND clause list.
    - pathSelector: # At least one 'pathSelector' entry must exist if typeDetection is specified

        rootPath: # example: /pom.xml, or /go.mod
        filenameWildcard: # example: server.xml, or *.go; this means recursively walk a project and look for filenames that match this pattern. Same pattern style as filewatcher.

```

#### Update History:
- September 16th: Remove `kind`, update `github-id` to `githubId`
- September 17th: Remove `buildImage: docker.io/maven:3.6` from `server-start`, remove `maven-cache-volume` volume, removed `spec.shared.volumes.labels` and `spec.shared.volumes.accessModes`. `env` updated to Kubernetes-style `key/value`, to allow easy parsing.
- September 20th: 
  - `sourceMappings` -> `sourceMapping`, and removed the `srcPath` field (will always sync from project root).
  - Removed `spec.shared.tasks`, and all the fields under it, as we have hardcoded defaults for these values.
  - Added ability to map volumes into runtime image (this was always implied, but is now included), under `spec.runtime.volumeMappings`
- September 23rd:
  - `runAsUser` removed from `spec.tasks`
  - `buildImage` renamed to `image` under `spec.tasks`
  - Replace previous memory limit with `kubernetes.requests` and `kubernetes.limits`
  - `image`, `volumeMappings`, `kubernetes`, and `env`, have moved from task to a new `shared.containers` entry, which tasks will reference by name.

- September 24th:
  - Added `Type` under `spec.tasks`, with a value of `Shared`, `Standalone`, or `Runtime`. 
  - Added `spec.runtime.overrideEntrypointTailToFile`

- October 7th:
  - `spec.tasks.command` is now a string array, rather than a single string. 

## Requirements
  
#### The time it takes for an existing volume to attach to a new Pod can be upwards of several minutes, as per external team's observations. We have not seen this ourselves, but we need to handle this. 
- For this reason, we are NOT tearing down our task containers on the completion of the task, and likewise task containers are shared across scenario runs.
  
#### There exists at least one case where we must override the entrypoint on the runtime, therefore (if we need to support this case) we need to support overriding the entrypoint in general:

IDP:
- Runtime Container A (Liberty MP, running as non-root)
- Task 1, runtime task, runs in container A.

Logic:
- If we don't override the entrypoint, then we need to put build content (server.xml, binaries) into `/config` for the runtime, before the runtime starts.
- This content can only be the result of a build task.
- But in this scenario, with only a runtime task, the task must run inside the runtime container, which hasn't started yet.
- One option is running the task inside an initContainer, but that doesn't actually work because we wouldn't be able to sync the source before the initContainer runs.
- Thus, since the build task can't run in a non-running container, and there is no other mechanism to run it, it is not possible to support this scenario w/o override the entrypoint.
